        <h2>What Makes This Cookie Dough Edible?</h2>
        <p>Traditional cookie dough is unsafe to consume before it’s baked because of the presence of eggs and raw flour.<br>
            This recipe doesn’t contain eggs at all, but it does contain all-purpose flour<br>
            — that’s why it’s important to heat-treat the flour before you incorporate it into the dough.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Vanilla</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Chocolate Chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To heat-treat your flour so it is safe to use:<br>
                Place flour in a microwave-safe dish and cook for 1 minute and 15 seconds, stirring it every 15 seconds.<br>
                Set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy.<br>
                Beat in vanilla extract and salt.<br>
                Add heat-treated flour; mix until a crumbly dough forms.<br>
                Stir in milk until dough is just combined; fold in milk chocolate chips and mini chocolate chips.</li>
        </ol>
